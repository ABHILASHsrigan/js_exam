🦠 COVID-19 State-wise Tracker

📊 Overview

The COVID-19 State-wise Tracker is a responsive, real-time web application designed to track the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across different states in a given country (e.g., India, USA, etc.). The application provides users with up-to-date statistics such as confirmed cases, active cases, recovered patients, and death counts, broken down by each state. It serves as an essential tool for public awareness, policy planning, and educational purposes.


This tracker integrates dynamic data fetching from official APIs (such as disease.sh, covid19india.org, or WHO sources), and visualizes the data in a clean, user-friendly interface using charts, tables, and maps.
